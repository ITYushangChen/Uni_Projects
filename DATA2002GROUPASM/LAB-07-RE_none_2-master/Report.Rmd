## Data Description

### New York House Prices Data
.pull-left[
+ Source: random sample of 1734 houses taken from full Saratoga Housing Data (De Veaux)
+ Our aim is to model the house prices as a function of up to 13 potential explanatory variables

```{r load_data, message=FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=12, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
prices = read_tsv("housing-prices-ge19.txt")
# Removing empty cells and categorical variables with > 2 levels
prices <- subset(prices, select = -Heat.Type)
prices <- subset(prices, select = -Fuel.Type)
prices <- subset(prices, select = -Sewer.Type)
prices_clean = prices %>%
  drop_na()

dim(prices_clean)

## Assumptions

1. .black[**Linearity**] - the relationship between $Y$ and $x$ is linear.
<br>
<br>
2. .black[**Independence**] - all the errors are independent of each other.
<br>
<br>
3. .black[**Homoskedasticity**] - the errors have constant variance
<br>
<br>
4. .black[**Normality**] - the errors follow a normal distribution

---

### Assumption Checking 

```{r, fig.dim=c(17,6), warning=FALSE}
lm1 = lm((Price) ~ ., data = prices_clean)
autoplot(lm1, which = 1:2)
```
---
### Transformation 
.font80[
We observed that our data set has very large values for Price, Living Area and Land Value. We therefore take their logs to transform our data.
]
.code80[
```{r, fig.dim=c(17,6), warning=FALSE}
lm2 = lm(log(Price) ~ Lot.Size + Waterfront + Age + log(Land.Value) + New.Construct + Central.Air + log(Living.Area) + Pct.College + Bedrooms + Fireplaces + Bathrooms + Rooms + Test, data = prices_clean)

autoplot(lm2, which = 1:2)
```
]

---
## Model Selection

### House Prices data: null and full model
.pull-left[
.scroll-box-20[
```{r}
M0 = lm(log(Price) ~ 1, data = prices_clean)  # Null model
M1 = lm(log(Price) ~ Lot.Size + Waterfront + Age + log(Land.Value) + New.Construct + Central.Air + log(Living.Area) + Pct.College + Bedrooms + Fireplaces + Bathrooms + Rooms + Test, data = prices_clean)  # Full model
round(summary(M1)$coef, 3)
```
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
t(round(broom::glance(M1), 2))
```
]

---

### House Prices data: backward search using AIC
Since none of the remaining variables have p value > 0.05, we don't have to drop any more variables from our model
.pull-left[
```{r}
step.back.aic = step(M1, 
                     direction = "backward", 
                     trace = FALSE)
round(summary(step.back.aic)$coef,3)
```
]
.pull-right[
.pull-right[
```{r}
step.back.aic %>%
  broom::glance() %>% 
  round(2) %>% t()
```
]
]
---
### House Prices data: foward search using AIC
.scroll-box-20[
```{r}
step.fwd.aic = step(M0, scope = list(lower = M0, upper = M1), direction = "forward", trace = FALSE)
summary(step.fwd.aic)
```
]
---
### Forward AIC: add1()
```{r}
add1(step.fwd.aic, test = "F", scope = M1)
```
---

### Comparing forward and backwards stepwise
Both forward and backward AIC gives us exactly the same model.
.pull-left[
```{r, fig.dim=c(2,6), warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  step.fwd.aic, step.back.aic, 
  show.ci = FALSE, 
  show.aic = TRUE,
  dv.labels = c("Forward model",
                "Backward model")
)
```
]
.scroll-box-20[
.pull-right[
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sjPlot::tab_model(
  step.fwd.aic, step.back.aic, 
  show.ci = FALSE, 
  show.aic = TRUE,
  dv.labels = c("Forward model",
                "Backward model")
)
```
]
]

---
## Assumpting Checking on selected model again
Assumptions appear to be fairly in check
```{r, fig.dim=c(17,6), warning=FALSE}
autoplot(step.fwd.aic, which = 1:2)

```
---

## Hypothesis Testing
.font80[
.black[**Hypothesis**]: 
$$H_0: \beta_{0} = \beta_{1} = \beta_{2} ... \beta_{10} = 0 \:vs\: H_1: \beta_{i} \neq 0 \:for \:i \in [1,10]$$
.black[**Assumptions**]: The residuals $\varepsilon_i$ are iid N(0, $\sigma^2$)
+ Linearity: There is no obvious pattern(e.g. smiley face or frowny face) in the blue line, it does not appear we have misspecified the model
+ Homoskedasticity: Some outliers are present, but majority of our points don’t appear to be fanning out or changing their variability over the range of the fitted values so the constant error variance assumption is met.
+ Normality: In the QQ plot, there are some outliers present, but most points fall on the line, so it’s not severe enough departure to cause too much concern.

.black[**Test Statistic**]: $$\frac{Change \:in \:SSR \:/ \:Number \:of \:variables \:droppped}{MSE_{Full}}$$

.black[**Observed Test Statistic**]: 243.2

.black[**p-Value**]: < 2.2e-16

.black[**Conclusion**]: Since the p-Value is < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Hence, there is evidence to suggest 
            that there is significant linear relationship between Price and the derived independent variables.

## Interpretating the estimated coefficients

.font70[
.content-box-blue[
$$log(Price) =   6.772185 + 0.034353*Lot Size + 0.532051*Waterfront - 0.001004*Age + 0.129429*log(Land Value) - 0.105948*New Construct$$ 
$$+ 0.060009*Central Air + 0.530313*log(Living Area) - 0.002448*Pct.College + 0.106487*Bathrooms + 0.012621*Rooms$$
]
]

.font80[
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Lot Size leads to a 0.034 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Waterfront leads to a 0.532 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Age leads to a 0.001 unit decrease in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Land Value leads to a 0.129 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in New Construct leads to a 0.106 unit decrease in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Central Air leads to a 0.060 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Living Area leads to a 0.530 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Pct.College leads to a 0.002 unit decrease in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Bathrooms leads to a 0.106 unit increase in house prices
+ On average, holding the other variables constant, a 1 unit increase in Rooms leads to a 0.013 unit increase in house prices
